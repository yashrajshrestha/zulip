# Test mobile notifications

Normally, mobile notifications are only sent after you've been idle for a
few minutes, which isn't ideal for testing.

You can instead have mobile notifications sent regardless of how recently
you've been online.

{start_tabs}

{settings_tab|notifications}

1. Under **Other notification settings**, enable
   **Send mobile notifications even if I'm online**.

{end_tabs}
